    \item An RCC short column $\brak{with lateral ties}$ of rectangular cross section of $250 mm * 300 mm$ is reinforced with four numbers of $16 mm$ diameter longitudinal bars. The grades of steel and concrete are $Fe415$ and $M20$,respectively. Neglect eccentricity effect. Considering limit state of collapse i  compression $\brak{IS 456 : 2000}$,the axial load carrying capacity of the column $\brak{in kN, up to one decimal place}$,is \\
 \item An  RCC beam of rectangular cross section has factored shear of $200 kN$ at its critical section. Its width $b$ is $250 mm$ and effective depth $d$ is $350 mm$.Assume design shear strength $\tau_{c}$ of concrete as $0.62 N/mm^{2}$ and maximum allowable shear stress $\tau_{c,max}$ in concrete as $2.8 N/mm^{2}$.If two legged $10 mm$ diameter vertical stirrup of $Fe250$ grade steel are used, then the required spacing $\brak{in cm,up to one decimal place}$ as per limit state method will be\\

\item A conventional drained triaxial compression test was conducted  on a normally consolidates clay sample under an effective pressure of $200 kPa$.the deviator stress at failure was found to be $400 kPa$. An identical specimen of the same clay sample is isoropically consolidated to a confining pressure of $200 kPa$ and subjected to standard undrained triaxial compression test.
